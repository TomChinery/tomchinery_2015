## Synopsis

A barebones theme to use as a base for new and exciting stuff. Uses Bower and Grunt which setup SASS plus some nice extras.

## Motivation

I needed to have a solid HTML5 friendly WordPress theme to build on top of. Didn't
find any I liked so made my own.

Bear is lightweight, only does what it needs to, and makes WordPress use better
markup.

## Installation

Clone the repository and move it into your themes folder. Then run:

    npm install

To use Grunt just do:

    grunt
